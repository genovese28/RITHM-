/*1. throwing an error stops the code from executing
2.  try/catch statements has a finally block(at the end)
it will execute regarless of an error being thrown.
3. Type error happens when you make incorrent use of cetain types.
A reference error occurs when you try to access a variable that does not exist in that scope.
4. To create a snippet you go to sources and the snppets are on the left and you right click 
to create a new snippets.  I'm using them now.
5. When an error occurs, JavaScript will normally stop and generate an error message.
throw an error is an exception.
 run(){
causeError;
 } catch(err) {
  console.log("this is an eror");
}
1. person; it's not initialized or declard.
to fix this you can use a try/catch or you throw a referenceError.
This is a reference error.  
2.  var data = {};
    //data.displayInfo();
displayInfo is not a function so this a TypeError.
use the throw keyword.
3. var data = {};
data.displayInfo.foo = "bar"; typeerror, foo is undefined.
4.function data(){
    var thing = "foo";
    }
     data();
    thing; referenceError,  thing is undefined, it's defined in the 
local but not global scope*/

/*PART 2

1. i starts at 0, it can't be greater then 5.  It's false.
   for(var i=0; i < 5; i++)(fixed)
2. we were intializing instead of comparing 0
   function addIfEven(num){
    if(num % 2 === 0){
        return num + 5;
    }
    return num;

3. we used commas insead of semi- colons
    function loopToFive(){
    for(var i=0; i < 5; i++){
        console.log(i);

4.  mistakes: used ; at the end of loop, = used instaed of ===, we're looping over the whole array
    (< numbers.length),  we have to check the value we're at(numbers[i]) and push the value to the array(push[i]).
    return has to return after the loop and condition.
    
    function displayEvenNumbers(){
    var numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8];
    var evenNumbers = [];
    for(var i=0; i<numbers.length-1; i++;){
        if(numbers[i] % 2 === 0); {
            evenNumbers.push[i]);
        }
    }
        return evenNumbers;
    
}
displayEvenNumbers();
